swiftly displaying ads w/ iframe

setup:
- clone repo
- npm install
- drop your ads into src/ads/
- update src/scripts/main.js array if needed
- npm start for local server
- npm run build for a dist/ build

if you get an EEXIST error on build run the script again, should work - gulpfile bug needs sorting sometime
